#Exercise A
data <- scan("part1.txt", sep="\n")
head(data)

charge = charge + sum(data)

```
```{r}

while (TRUE){
    if(i == length(data)){
        i <- 1 
    }
    charge <- charge + data[i]
    if(charge %in% unique(nums)){

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
